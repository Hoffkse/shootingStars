Spaceship asteroid avoider game made in Java

This is a simple game I made in java in which you need to use the arrow keys to guide the spaceship to the yellow warp on the right side of the screen. You can increase/decrease the speed of the spaceship by uing the up and down arrow keys in increments. All walls will bounce you off in the opposite direction. 

You only have one life per game round. At the death of your spaceship, a score will be given based on how many levels you progressed through. Each level will increase the amount of randomly moving asterooids on the screen.
